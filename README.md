# Path-Planning-Algorithms-Python

#### Purpose
To understand and implement path planning algorithms from scratch for education purposes.

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm (or Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF algorithm)[1] is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks

#### A* Algorithm
A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.

#### Dijkstra's / A-star algorithm

#### Instructions
Required packages : numpy,matplotLib (can be intalled using pip install command)
Clone the respository and run the .py files using the python command on the terminal.
Reduce the map size and adjust start and end goal accordingly for the code to execute and finish quickly.
